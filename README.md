# 416-Map-Redistricting
This project is for our CSE 416 Senior Project Design.

# Overview
This project allows the user to choose one of three states (California, Pennsylvania, Louisiana) and then generate many possible congressional districts for the selected state based on precinct data. The user will then see data such as racial/ethnicity, preferred political party, and if the congressional district is fair for each district for each of the many generated maps. The Stony Brook Seawulf super computer is used to help compute the redistricted maps.

# Languages

-Java was used for the Server logic, interacting with the database, and connecting to the Seawulf computer
-Python was used for creaitng the database.
