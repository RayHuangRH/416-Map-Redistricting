This explains the structure of this the jsons folder.

Precincts folder will have the 3 states precincts data.

Districtings folder will have all the job's completed data. The name of each file will be job{#id}.json where the id is the same from the database.

Summaries folder will have the job's summary formatted data. The name of each file will be job{#id}.json where the id is the same from the database.


THIS IS MY CURRENT IDEA, COULD CHANGE IF WE NEED TO !!!
